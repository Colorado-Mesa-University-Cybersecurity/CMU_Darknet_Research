# Variational Auto-Encoder Data

Here we house the datasets produced by variational auto-encoders.

Explorational Datasets: (These were produced while ignoring methodology to explore the dataset before experimentation)
 * vae_balanced_traffic_dataset_1_all_labels.csv
 * vae_balanced_traffic_dataset_2_traffic_labels.csv
 * vae_balanced_traffic_dataset_3_traffic_3_labels.csv

Experimental Datasets: (These are the experiments that were produced while adhering to the experiment methodology for the purpose of the study)
